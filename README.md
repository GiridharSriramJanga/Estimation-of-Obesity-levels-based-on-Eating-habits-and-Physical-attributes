# Estimation-of-Obesity-levels-based-on-Eating-habits-and-Physical-attributes

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to classify obesity risk levels using machine learning and identify key lifestyle and dietary features contributing to obesity. By analyzing public health-related data, the project provides insights into the most influential factors behind rising obesity trends — a major public health concern globally.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Classify individuals based on obesity risk levels using supervised learning models.
- Perform feature analysis to identify key dietary and lifestyle patterns linked to obesity.
- Derive public health insights that can inform early interventions and prevention strategies.

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

- **Source**: Public health dataset on lifestyle and physical traits (e.g., BMI, exercise frequency, food intake habits).
- **Format**: CSV (assumed to be preloaded in the notebook).
- **Target**: Obesity level (multi-class classification).

## ⚙️ Key Steps

- **EDA & Cleaning**: Identified nulls, outliers, and categorical distributions.  
- **Visualization**: Explored trends in physical activity, calorie intake, and family history across obesity levels.  
- **Modeling**: Trained multiple classifiers including Random Forest, SVM, and KNN to predict obesity risk levels.  
- **Evaluation**: Compared accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices to select the best model.

---

## 📊 Key Results

- Random Forest achieved the highest classification accuracy among tested models.  
- Feature importance highlighted high calorie food consumption and physical activity frequency as dominant factors.  
- Clear risk segmentation observed based on age, work activity, and water intake levels.

---

## 💡 Public Health Insights

- Inactive lifestyles and frequent consumption of high-calorie food are the top indicators of obesity risk.
- Health promotion strategies should emphasize balanced diets and active routines, especially in young adults.
- Preventative interventions should target individuals with a family history of obesity for early behavioral change.
